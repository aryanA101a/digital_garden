You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you'd like to get.\n\nThe majority of configuration can be found under `data/config.yaml`. An annotated example configuration is shown below.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# The name to display in the footer\nname: Jacky Zhao\n\n# whether to globally show the table of contents on each page\n# this can be turned off on a per-page basis by adding this to the\n# front-matter of that note\nenableToc: true\n\n# whether to by-default open or close the table of contents on each page\nopenToc: false\n\n# whether to display on-hover link preview cards\nenableLinkPreview: true\n\n# whether to render titles for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockTitle: true \n\n# whether to render copy buttons for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockCopy: true \n\n# whether to try to process Latex\nenableLatex: true\n\n# whether to enable single-page-app style rendering\n# this prevents flashes of unstyled content and improves\n# smoothness of Quartz.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](notes/troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Language Support\n[CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(ÊµãËØï).md) comes out of the box with Quartz.\n\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'ŸÖÿØŸàŸÜÿ™Ÿä'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2022-07-29T18:05:17.846908302Z","tags":null},"/.trash/custom-Domain":{"title":"Custom Domain","content":"\n### Registrar\nThis step is only applicable if you are using a **custom domain**! If you are using a `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io` domain, you can skip this step.\n\nFor this last bit to take effect, you also need to create a CNAME record with the DNS provider you register your domain with (i.e. NameCheap, Google Domains).\n\nGitHub has some [documentation on this](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site), but the tldr; is to\n\n1.

You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question. Please note that **all links should be relative to the root `/content` path**. \n\n```markdown\nFor example, I want to link this current document to `notes/config.md`.\n[A link to the config page](notes/config.md)\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can put local images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\nYou can also use wikilinks if that is what you are more comfortable with!\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files. Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so. You can also add tags here as well.\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Example Title\"\ntags:\n- example-tag\n---\n\nRest of your content here...\n```\n\n### Obsidian\nI recommend using [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) as a way to edit and grow your digital garden.

If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.\n\n### Enable GitHub Actions\nBy default, GitHub disables workflows from running automatically on Forked Repostories. Head to the 'Actions' tab of your forked repository and Enable Workflows to setup deploying your Quartz site!\n\n![Enable GitHub Actions](notes/images/github-actions.png)*Enable GitHub Actions*\n\n### Enable GitHub Pages\n\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\n\n1.

Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

BIOS (Basic Input/output System):\n\n*   The BIOS is a SW that's stored in ROM on the motherboard and is usually completely HW specific/dependent.\n*   Initializes the HW (Screen, keyboard, etc.)\n*   Tests the main memory (POST: Power On Self Test).\n\n### 2\\. The Bootloader :\n\n*   The program responsible for loading into memory the Kernel\n*   It also loads into memory the initial RAM-based filesystem or **\\_initramfs\\_** so it can be used by the kernel\n*   Common bootloaders for Linux:\n    *   **GRUB** (for **GR**and **U\\*_nified \\*_B**oot loader)\n    *   ISOLINUX (for booting from removable media)\n*   Stored on one of the partitions of one of the Hard disks in the system. It can be stored in:\n    *   The boot sector in MBR (Master Boot Records) Systems.\n    *   UEFI or EFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface partition) systems.\n\n##### Stage 1:\n\n##### MBR (Master Boot Record) Systems\n\n*   The Bootloder resides in first sector of the hard disk known as the MBR which size is 512 bytes.\n*   The bootloader examines the partition table and find the bootable partion.\n*   Searches the second stage bootloader (e.g. GRUB) and loads it into RAM.\n\n##### UEFI/EFI (Unified Extended Firmware Interface) Systems\n\n*   Reads the BOOT Manager data to determine which UEFI application will be launched and from which disk and partition the EFI partition can be found.\n*   Launches the found application (e.g. GRUB) and loads it into RAM.\n\n##### Stage 2:\n\n*   The second stage boot loader resides under `/boot`\n*   A screen to select an OS is presented to select the OS\n*   The selected OS Kernel is uncompressed (Usually is compressed)\n*   Check and analyze the system HW and initialize any HW device drivers built into the kernel.\n*   The Kernel is loaded into RAM and the bootloader passes control to it.\n\n### 3\\. The Kernel:\n\n*   After the Kernel is loaded it initializes and configures the memory and all the HW attached to the system (processor, I/O subsystems, storage devices, etc.)\n*   Loads some neccessary user space apps\n\n### 4\\. The Initial RAM Disk:\n\n*   The initramfs contains programs an binary files that perform all actions needed to mount the proper root filesystem\n*   Essential programs of initramfs:\n    \n    *   udev:\n        *   provides kernel funcionality and device drivers for mass storage controllers\n        *   responsible for figuring out the present devices and find drivers they need to operate properly\n        *   after a root filesystem is found it is checked for error and mounted\n    *   mount:\n        *   instructs the OS that a filesystem is ready for use and associates it with a particular point in the overall hierachy of the filesystem (mount point)?\n*   If the essential programs are successful the initramfs is cleared from RAM and the **init** (/sbin/init) program on the root filesystem is executed\n    \n\n![](./img/initramfs.jpg)\n\n### 5\\. /sbin/init and Service\n\n*   Once the kernel has set up all its hardware and mounted the root filesystem, the kernel runs the `/sbin/init` program\n*   This `init` program becomes the initial process and starts other processes to get the system running.\n    \n    \u003e Kernel processes are an exception because they are stared directly by the kernel for managing internal OS system calls\n    \n*   The init program is responsible for keeping the system running and for shutting it down cleanly\n    \n*   Acts a manager for all the **non-kernel** processes, cleaning up after them and controlling and restarts users log in and out, it does the same for other background system services.\n*   Handles the mounting and pivoting over the final real root filesystem?\n\n### 6\\. Command Shell\n\n*   init is responsible for starting a number of text-mode login prompts (ussually done by the **getty** program) which allow you to eventually get a command shell if the login is successful\n\n![](./img/init_login.jpg)\n\n### 7\\. X Windows System or X Display Manager\n\n*   Usually as the final boot process step the [X Windows System](#dis_mngr) is loaded which is the one that calls [display manager](#dis_mngr) service\n\n#### Selecting a distro\n\n*   Installing a Linux distro can be done completely automatically using a config file to specify installation options (preseed file for the Debian-based systems like Ubuntu).\n*   What packages are important\n*   main function of the system (server, desktop, embedded)\n*   Available disk space and HW (x86, ARM, PPC, etc.)\n*   Support, updates and stability for release\n\n![](./img/select_linux_distro.jpg)\n\n#### System Startup (systemd)\n\n*   It is the startup system used on most recent Linux distros\n*   It uses configuration files, which enumerate what has to be done before a service is started, how to execute service startup, and what conditions the service should indicate have been accomplished when startup is finished\n*   It uses the `systemctl` for most basic tasks\n    *   start/stop/restart: `sudo systemctl {start|stop|restart} \u003cname_of_service\u003e`\n    *   enable/disable: `sudo systemctl {enable|disable} \u003cname_of_service\u003e`\n\nChapter 4-5: Graphical Interface \u0026 System Configuration from the Graphical Interface\n====================================================================================\n\n#### Display Manager / X Display Manager / X Windows System\n\n*   After the X Window System is loaded it usually calls the display manager service\n*   The Display Manager is the one responsible for:\n    *   Display Management (Keep track of the number of displays being provided)\n    *   Loading the X Server\n    *   Manage/handle graphical logins and starts appropriate desktop environment after log in\n*   Ubuntu uses **lightgdm** display manager\n*   The display manager is run as a service, you can stop the GUI desktop with the systemctl utility\n    *   `sudo systemctl {stop|start} gdm` (or `sudo telinit 3`)\n\n![](./img/disp_manager.jpg)\n\n#### Desktop enviroment\n\nConsist of:\n\n*   **Session manager:** Starts and maintains graphical components\n*   **Window Manager:** Controls the placement and movements of windows, windows title bars and controls\n*   Usually a set of utilities, session manager, and window manager are used together as a unit to provide a desktop environment.\n\n![](./img/desktop_env.jpg)\n\n\u003e **GNOME** is an example of a Desktop enviroment which uses **gdm** display manager\n\n#### System Configuration Miscellaneous Information\n\n*   **Nautilus:** File manager browser\n*   The X server handled by the windows X and which actually provides the GUI, uses the `/etc/X11/xorg.conf` file as its configuration file if it exists\n*   The **Network Time Protocol (NTP)** is the most popular and reliable protocol for setting the local time via Internet servers (the `/etc/ntp.conf` file contains configurations for this functionality).\n*   Linux uses **Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)** for its own internal time-keeping.\n*   A deleted file is moved to the trash usually at `/home/user/.local/share/Trash/files`\n*   Find out the current screen resolution: `xdpyinfo | grep dim`\n*   the `init.d` directory is no longer used much in systemd-based systems (systemd), but is kept for backwards compatibility reasons\n\nChapter 6: Package Management and Common Applications\n=====================================================\n\n### Packages and SW updates\n\n*   A package is a piece of software that provides a piece of the system. Examples of packages:\n    *   Linux Kernel\n    *   The C compiler\n    *   The Firefox web browser\n    *   The USB library to interact with USB devices\n*   Packages have dependencies from other packages that must also be downloaded and installed before installing the package with dependencies.\n*   A package contains the files and other instructions needed to make one SW component work on the system\n\n#### Package Management System\n\n*   The packet manager is the utility that handles the downloading, unpacking and putting the unpacket pieces in the right places.\n*   Consists of two entities: a low-level tool (such as dpkg or rpm), takes care of the details of unpacking individual packages, running scripts, getting the software installed correctly, while a high-level tool (such as apt-get, yum, or zypper) works with groups of packages, downloads packages from the vendor, and figures out dependencies\n*   The core parts of a linux distro and most of its add-on SW are installed via a Package Management System\n    \n*   Debian Family System\n    \n    *   **dpkg**:\n        *   low-level or underlying packet manager\n        *   Unpacks, installs, removes and build packages\n        *   It can't download or resolve dependencies\n    *   **Advance Package Tool (apt)** :\n        \n        *   Build on top of **dpkg** (depends on it)\n        *   works with groups of packages\n        *   It can automatically download and install packages to figure out and resolve dependencies.\n        *   Tts native user interface is through the **apt-get** and **apt-cache** commands\n        *   Usually a user interface is created on top of it for an specific distro (SW update GUIs are an example of this)\n            \n            ![Packaging Process Debian family](./img/pack_dep.jpg)\n            \n*   Fedora Family System\n    \n    *   **Red Hat Package Manager (rpm)**:\n        *   low-level or underlying packet manager\n    *   **Yellowdog Updater (yum)**:\n        *   The high-level package manager differs between distribution but yum is commonly used\n    *   **Dandified Yum (dnf)**:\n        *   It is the next-generation version of yum\n\n![](./img/linux_pack_mngr.jpg)\n\n##### Packaging commands\n\n*   low-level packaging commands operates on individual packages\n*   high-level packaging commands operates on multiple packages and deal with dependencies\n\nOperation\n\nRPM\n\ndeb\n\nInstall/Updates package\n\n`rpm -i foo.rpm`\n\n`dpkg --install foo.deb`\n\nInstall package, dependencies\n\n`yum install foo`\n\n`apt-get install foo`\n\nRemove package\n\n`rpm -e foo.rpm`\n\n`dpkg --remove foo.deb`\n\nRemove package, dependencies\n\n`yum remove foo`\n\n`apt-get autoremove foo`\n\nUpdate package\n\n`rpm -U foo.rpm`\n\n`dpkg --install foo.deb`\n\nUpdate package, dependencies\n\n`yum update foo`\n\n`apt-get install foo`\n\nUpdate entire system\n\n`yum update`\n\n`apt-get dist-upgrade`\n\nShow all installed packages\n\n`rpm -qa` or `yum list installed`\n\n`dpkg --list`\n\nGet information on package\n\n`rpm -qil foo`\n\n`dpkg --listfiles foo`\n\nShow packages named foo\n\n`yum list \"foo\"`\n\n`apt-cache search foo`\n\nShow all available packages\n\n`yum list`\n\n`apt-cache dumpavail foo`\n\nWhat package is file part of?\n\n`rpm -qf file`\n\n`dpkg --search file`\n\n### Common Applications\n\nApplication\n\nUse\n\nFileZilla\n\nIntuitive graphical FTP client that supports FTP, Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), and FTP Secured (FTPS).

These are not the same as the command line terminal window\n    \n    *   **Set variables:** creating variables that can be used as arguments of a command\n*   The desktop manager is simply a service that can be stopped (`sudo service gdm stop` or `sudo service lightdm stop`)\n    \n*   The `/etc/sudoers.d/\u003cuser_name\\\u003e` file is the configuration file that enables/disables user account to use sudo.\n    *   `\u003cuser_name\\\u003e ALL=(ALL) ALL`\n    *   `chmod 440 /etc/sudoers.d/\u003cuser_name\\\u003e`\n\nCommands Dictionary\n-------------------\n\n### Basic Operations\n\n#### ssh\n\n*   ssh [username@remote-server.com](mailto:username@remote-server.com)\n\n#### shutdown\n\nShutdown system operations:\n\n*   **halt** and **poweroff** are equivalent to **shutdown -h** which shutdown the system (sudo)\n*   **reboot** is equivalent to **shutdown -r** which reboot system (sudo)\n\n#### which and whereis\n\n*   Executables programs ussualy live in:\n    *   `/bin`\n    *   `/usr/bin`\n    *   `/sbin`\n    *   `/usr/sbin`\n    *   `/opt`\n*   The following commands can be used to locate programs\n    *   **which:** Locates a program\n    *   **whereis:** Search for a program in broader range of system directories\n\n#### cd and directory navigation\n\n*   **pwd:** Displays current directory\n*   **cd ~ /cd:** Change to Home directory\n*   **cd ..:** Change to parent directory\n*   **cd -:** Change to previous directory\n*   **cd /:** Change to root directory\n*   **ls:** List content of current directory\n*   **ls -a:** List ALL content of current directory (include hidden files)\n*   **ls -l:** Use long listing format\n*   **ls -i:** display [**inode**](#inode_link)\n*   **tree:** Display tree view of the filesystem (include files in the tree view)\n*   **tree -d:** Display folders in a tree view of the filesystem\n*   **pushd:** pushes the current directory to the history stack\n*   **popd:** pops the latest added directory of the history stack\n*   **dirs:** Displays the directories in the stack\n\n#### Symbolic Links\n\n*   **inode:** Unique file identifier\n*   **Hard links:** N/A\n*   **Soft links:** can point to objects even on different filesystems (or partitions) which may or may not be currently available or even exist\n*   **ln \u003cexistent\\_file\u003e \u003cname\\_of\\_link\\_file\u003e:** Creates hard link\n*   **ln -s \u003cexistent\\_file\u003e \u003cname\\_of\\_link\\_file\u003e:** Creates soft link\n\n### File Streams\n\n*   In Linux all open files are represented by **file streams/descriptors** which are just numbers used as identifiers\n*   File streams opened by default:\n    *   **stdin (0)**\n    *   **stdout (1)**\n    *   **stderr (2)**\n*   If other files are opened in addition to the default opened streams, they will start at file descriptor 3 and increase from there.\n\n#### I/O redirection\n\n*   we can redirect the input or output of a stream using the **\\\u003e\\*_, \\*_\u003c** and **\u0026** (File descriptor identifier) operators. Examples:\n    *   `do_something \u003e output-file`\n    *   `do_something \u003c input-file`\n    *   `do_something \u003cfile-descriptor-number\\\u003e \u003e output-file`\n    *   `do_something \u003e all-output-file 2\u003e\u00261` equivalent to `do_something \u003e\u0026 all-output-file` which redirects file descriptor 2 to 1\n\n### Pipes (|)\n\n*   Used to have one program take as input the output of another.\n*   Allows to combine the actions of several commands into one using the pipe symbol **|**\n    *   `command1 | command2 | command3`\n\nFiles\n-----\n\n### Searching for Files\n\n#### Locate\n\n*   Search through a previously constructed DB of files and dirs\n    *   the DB is created by the **updatedb** program/command, usually automatically run by Linux (SUDO)\n*   Match entries with a specified string\n\n#### Wildcards\n\nUsed to locate a filename containing a specific character(s)\n\n*   **?:** matches any **single** character\n*   **\\*:** matches any **string** character\n*   **\\[set\\] and \\[!set\\]:** matches any character in the set of or not (!) in the set of characters\n\n#### find\n\n*   Search for files\n    *   `find \u003cdir-to-search\\\u003e \u003coptions\\\u003e \u003cinput-string-no-quotes\\\u003e`\n*   arguments do not need quotes \"\"\n*   with no arguments it lists all files in the current dir and all fof its subdirs.

Some processes are independent of each other and others are related\n*   **Process**: It's an instance of one or more related tasks (threads) executing on your computer. A process uses system's resources (memory, CPU, peripherals, etc) through the OS specially the Kernel which is responsible for allocating a proper share of these resources to each process and ensuring overall optimum utilization\n*   **Program**: or a **command**, it's NOT the same as a process but it can start several process simultanmeoulsy\n\n![](./img/proc_kernel.jpg)\n\nProcess Types\n-------------\n\nProcess can be of different types according to the task being performed\n\n*   **Interactive process**:\n    *   Need to be started by an user.\n    *   Examples: bash, firefox, top...\n*   **Batch process**:\n    *   Automatic processes which are scheduled from and then disconnected from the terminal. Work on a FIFO scheme.\n    *   Examples: updatedb\n*   **Daemons**:\n    *   Server process that run continuously usually in the background\n    *   Many are launched during system startup and wait for requests of their services.\n    *   Examples: httpd, xinetd, sshd...\n*   **Threads**:\n    *   Lightweight processes\n    *   These are tasks that run under the umbrella of a main process, sharing memory and other resources\n    *   Usually started from another main process to process data in parallel\n    *   Examples: firefox, gnome-terminal-server...\n*   **Kernel Threads**:\n    *   Not started nor terminated by the user. Perform kernel actions like moving a thread from one CPU to another or making sure I/O operations are completed\n    *   Examples: kthreadd, migration, ksoftirqd...\n\n### Scheduling Process\n\n*   A critical kernel function called the scheduler constantly shares the CPU between processes\n*   Process Status:\n    *   **running:** means it is either currently executing instructions on a CPU, or is waiting to be granted a share of time. On a run queue\n    *   **sleep:** generally when they are waiting for something to happen before they can resume. On a wait queue\n    *   **zombie:** if a child process completes, but its parent process has not asked about its state\n*   The **priority** for a process can be set by specifying a **nice value**, or **niceness**, for the process. The lower the nice value, the higher the priority. A nice value of -20 represents the highest priority and 19 represents the lowest.\n\n![](./img/proc_sched.jpg)\n\n### Identifiers\n\n*   **PID (Process ID)**: Unique ID that identifies the process, used to track process state, CPU usage, memory usage, where resources are located in memory, etc.\n    *   PID=1 denotes the **/sbin/init** process\n*   **PPID (Parent Process ID)**: Process (Parent) that started this process\n*   **TID (Thread ID)**:\n    *   The same as PID for single-threaded processes\n    *   For multi-threaded process each shares same PID but has unique TID\n*   **RUID (Real User ID)**: Identifies the user who starts the process\n*   **EUID (Effective User ID)**: Identifies the user who determines the rights for a user\n*   **RGID (Real Group ID)**: Identifies the group that starts the process\n*   **EGID (Effective Group ID)**: Identifies the Group that determines the rights for a group\n\n### Process Commands\n\n*   `ps` is the most common command to get information about the running processes\n    *   `-u`: option to display information of process for a specified user name\n    *   `-ef`: option display in detail all process in full detail\n    *   `-eLf`: displays on line of info for every thread (a process can have multiple threads)\n    *   `ps aux`: Displays all processes of all users\n    *   `ps axo \u003coptions\u003e`: specify which attributes you want to view like: stat, priority, pid, pcpu, comm\n*   `top` for monitoring live updating info. It also provides interactive keys like: `A` (sort top consumers), `k` (kill), `o` (new sort option), ...\n*   The `pstree` displays the processes running on the system in the form of a tree diagram showing the relationship between a process and its parent process, threads are displayed {} and repeated process are not displayed\n*   To kill a process we can use the `kill` command but you can only do this to your own process those belonging to another user are offlimit unless you are roor\n    *   `kill -SIGKILL \u003cpid\u003e`\n*   **Load average**: Determines how busy the system is, can be obtained with `w`, `top` or `uptime` and presents in 3 numbers average over the past 1 minute, over the past 5 minutes and over the past 15 minutes:\n    *   **\\==1\\*NUM\\_CPUs**: Fully subscribed but not overloaded\n    *   **\\\u003e1\\*NUM\\_CPUs** : Overloaded, process are competing for CPU time\n    *   **\u003c1\\*NUM\\_CPUs** : Under-loaded\n*   the `at` utility program is used to execute any non-interactive command at a specified time. You can see queued jobs with `atq` Ex:\n    \n              at now + 2 days\n              commands\n              ...\n    \n\n#### cron\n\n*   it is a time-based scheduling utility program. It can launch routine background jobs at specific times and/or days on an on-going basis\n*   cron is driven by a configuration file `/etc/crontab` (cron table) which contains the various shell commands that need to be run at the properly scheduled times\n*   Each line of a crontab file represents a job, and is composed of a so-called CRON expression, followed by a shell command to execute (6 fields in total).\n*   `/etc/crontab` is the system wide crontab\n*   `crontab -e` edits the user crontab, these are crontab per user files stores in `/var/spool/cron/crontabs/\u003cusername\u003e`\n    *   use `sudo crontab -e` to edit the root crontab\n\nField\n\nDescription\n\nValues\n\nMIN\n\nMinutes\n\n0 to 59\n\nHOUR\n\nHour\n\n0 to 23\n\nDOM\n\nDay of Month\n\n1-31\n\nMON\n\nMonth field\n\n1-12\n\nDOW\n\nDay Of Week\n\n0-6 (0 = Sunday)\n\nCMD\n\nCommand\n\nAny command to be executed\n\n    30 08 10 06 * /home/user/script.sh # run the script.sh at 8.30am, 10-June, irrespective of the day of the week.\n\n#### Background and Foreground Processes\n\n*   A **job** is just a command launched from a terminal window\n*   **Foreground** jobs run directly from the shell/GUI, and when one foreground job is running, other jobs need to wait for shell/GUI access\n*   **Background** jobs run with a lower priority which does no lock the shell/GUI\n*   by default all jobs are executed in the foreground. Use the `\u0026` operator to put a job in the background or the `bg` and `fg` commands to run a process in the background and foreground,\n*   background jobs are connected to the terminal window if you log off, the jobs utility will not show the ones started from that window.\n*   The **jobs -l** utility can be use to view all the jobs running in the background\n\nChapter 10: File Operations and Filesystems\n===========================================\n\nFiles and Filesystems\n---------------------\n\n*   In Linux (and all UNIX-like OS) everything is treated as a file (it doesn't mean it actually is a file)\n*   Whether you are dealing with normal data files and documents, or with devices such as sound cards and printers, you interact with them through the same kind of Interfaces and/or Input/Output (I/O) operations.\n*   The Linux filesystem is a tree that starts at the **trunk** or **root (/)**\n\n### Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)\n\n*   Provides a standadrd directory structure for the FS which provides consistency between systems and distros. Check [FHS](http://www.pathname.com/fhs/) for more info.\n*   Linux support various filesystems:\n    *   Native Linux filesystems: ext3, ext4, btrfs, xfs\n        *   filesystems from other operating systems: vfat, ntfs, hfs\n\n### Partitions\n\n![](./img/partition_ex.jpg \"Partitions example\")\n\n*   Each filesystem resides on a hard disk partition\n*   The partitions help organize data according to the kind of data contained and how it is used. For example:\n    *   important data in a root partition\n    *   user files in home partition\n    *   temp files in a tmp partition.\n\n#### Mount and Mount points\n\n![](./img/mount_points_ex.jpg \"Mount points diagram example\")\n\n*   **Mount/Mounting** is the operation that must be performed to start using a filesystem. It must be done at a **mount point** which simply is a directory where the filesystem will be attached (mounted)\n*   device-node: reference to partition with a filesystem in a device\n*   The mounting and retrieving partitions info:\n    *   **mount \u003cdevice-node\u003e \u003cmount-point\u003e:** mounts a filesystem (SUDO)\n    *   **mount :** Shows all presently mounted filesystems\n    *   **df -Th:** will display information about mounted filesystems\n*   The `/etc/fstab` file contains the filesystem table that contains the filesystems that will be mounted and configured automatically by the system.\n*   The `mount` command without options and arguments will list all of the currently mounted filesystems, along with information that will indicate whether they are mounted as read-only or writable\n\n\u003e warning: If you mount a filesystem on a non-empty directory, the former contents of that directory are covered-up and not accessible until the filesystem is unmounted. Thus mount points are usually empty directories.\n\n#### Network Filesystem (NFS)\n\n*   Mounting a home local directory on a server allows an user to have access to shared files or resources because other users home directories can also be mounted on the server\n\n##### NFS on the server\n\n*   the `etc/exports` file contains the directories and permissions that a host is willing to share with other systems over NFS. Entry file format:\n    *   \\*.\u003cdomain\u003e(\u003cpermisions\u003e). Ecample `/projects *.example.com(rw)`\n*   To share a directory using NFS on the server:\n    *   starts NFS services: `sudo systemctl start nfs`\n    *   modify `etc/exports` file appropriately\n    *   notify update: `exportfs -av` or `sudo systemctl restart nfs`\n\n##### NFS on the client\n\n*   To share a directory using NFS on the client:\n    *   mount the NFS:\n        *   modify `/etc/fstab` file:\n            *   `servername:/projects /mnt/nfs/projects nfs defaults 0 0`\n        *   manually mount the NFS:\n            *   `sudo mount servername:/projects /mnt/nfs/projects`\n\n#### proc Filesystem\n\n*   It's a pseudo filesystem because it has no permanent presence on disk\n*   Mounted on `/proc`\n*   Contains virtual files (exists only in volatile memory) that permit viewing constantly varying kernel data\n*   Contains files and dirs that mimic kernel data structs and config info so it can be viewed.\n*   Contains runtime system info like: system memory, devices mounted, hardware configuration, etc\n*   It does `NOT` contain real files, but runtime system information\n*   There is a directory for every process (`/proc/\u003cProcess-ID-#\u003e`)\n*   The information on proc is never stored permanently on disk\n*   Important files:\n    *   `/proc/cpuinfo`\n    *   `/proc/interrupts`\n    *   `/proc/meminfo`\n    *   `/proc/mounts`\n    *   `/proc/partitions`\n    *   `/proc/version`\n    *   `/proc/sys`\n\n### Filesystem architecture\n\n*   Each user has a home directory under /home\n*   the /root dir is just the root user's home directory\n*   The /home dir is usually mounted as a separated FS on its or shared remotely though NFS\n\n### Linux Directories\n\n#### /bin and /sbin\n\n*   **/bin:** Contains executable binaries and essential commands required by all system users\n*   **/sbin:** Contains essential binaries related to system administration\n*   **/usr/bin:** Contains non-essential commands used in single-user mode\n*   **/usr/sbin:** Less essential system admin programs\n\n\u003e On the newest Linus distributions, /usr/bin and /bin are actually just symbolically linked together, as are /usr/sbin and /sbin.\n\n#### /dev\n\n*   Contains **device nodes** which are pseudo files used by most HW and SW devices except for network devices.\n*   Contains entries created by the **udev** system which creates and manages device nodes on Linux when devices are found. eg:\n    *   /dev/sda1 (first partition on the first hard disk)\n    *   /dev/lp1 (second printer)\n    *   /dev/dvd1 (first DVD drive)\n\n#### /var and /etc\n\n*   **/var:** Contains files expected to change in size and content as the system is running.\n    *   System log files: `/var/log`\n    *   Packages and database files: `/var/lib`\n    *   Print queues: `/var/spool`\n    *   Temp files: `/var/tmp`\n*   **/etc:** Home for the system configuration files. It does not contain binary programs\n    *   `resolv.conf` tells the system where to go on the network to obtain host name to IP address mappings (DNS)\n    *   `passwd`, `shadow` and `group` are for managing user accounts\n    *   System run level scripts are found in subdirectories\n\n#### /boot\n\n*   Contains essential files needed to boot the system. For every alternative kernel installed on the system there are four files:\n    1.  **vmlinuz:** the compressed Linux kernel, required for booting\n    2.  **initramfs:** the initial ram filesystem, required for booting, sometimes called initrd, not initramfs\n    3.  **config:** the kernel configuration file, only used for debugging and bookkeeping\n    4.  **System.map:** kernel symbol table, only used for debugging\n\n\u003e Each of the boot files has a kernel version appended to its name.\n\n*   It also contains the **Grand Unified Bootloader (GRUB)** files (such as /boot/grub/grub.conf or /boot/grub2/grub2.cfg)\n\n#### /lib and /media, /run, /mnt\n\n*   **/lib:**\n    *   Contains libraries for the essential programs in `/bin` and `/sbin`.\n    *   Contains the dynamically loaded libraries (a.k.a. shared libraries or Shared Objects (SO)).\n    *   Kernel modules (kernel code, often device drivers, that can be loaded and unloaded without re-starting the system) are located in `/lib/modules`.\n*   **/media:** The directory where removable media, such as CDs, DVDs and USB drives are mounted\n    *   Newer Linux distributions place these mount points under the `/run` or `/run/media` directory.\n        *   **/mnt:** Used for temporarily mounting filesystems like network filesystems with NFS, not normally mounted or temporary partitions.\n\n#### Other dirs\n\n*   **/opt:** optional app SW packages.\n*   **/sys:** virtual filesystem that gives information about the system and HW (for param HW config and debugging).\n*   **/srv:** site specifa data used by the system.\n*   **/tmp:** temporary files.\n*   **/usr:** Multi-user applications utilities, non-essential (not needed to boot) programs and scripts.\n    *   **/usr/include:** Header files used to compile applications.\n    *   **/usr/lib:** Libraries for programs in `/usr/bin` and `/usr/sbin`.\n    *   **/usr/lib64:** 64-bit libraries for 64-bit programs in `/usr/bin` and `/usr/sbin`.\n    *   **/usr/sbin:** Non-essential system binaries, such as system daemons.\n    *   **/usr/share:** Shared data used by applications, generally architecture-independent.\n    *   **/usr/src:** Source code, usually for the Linux kernel.\n    *   **/usr/X11R6:** X Window configuration files; generally obsolete.\n    *   **/usr/local:** Data and programs specific to the local machine. Subdirectories include `bin`, `sbin`, `lib`, share, include, etc.\n    *   **/usr/bin:** This is the primary directory of executable commands on the system.\n\nwhats the difference between /sys and /proc/sys\n\n### Managing Files and Dirs\n\n#### diff and diff3\n\n*   **diff :** used to compare files.\n*   **diff -c \u003cfilename1\u003e \u003cfilename2\u003e:** compare files including context lines.\n*   **diff -r \u003cfilename1\u003e \u003cfilename2\u003e:** compare dirs and files recursively.\n*   **diff -i \u003cfilename1\u003e \u003cfilename2\u003e:** ignore case of letters\n*   **diff -w \u003cfilename1\u003e \u003cfilename2\u003e:** ignore differences in tabs and spaces\n*   **diff3 \u003cmy-file\u003e \u003ccommon-file\u003e \u003cothers-file\u003e:** compare 3 files at once using one a base\n\n#### patch \u0026 patches\n\n*   a **patch** is a file that contains **deltas** which are changes required to update a file.\n    *   **diff -Nur \u003coriginal\\_file\u003e \u003cnewfile\u003e \u003cpatchfile\\_name\u003e:** Creates a patch\n    *   **patch -p1 \u003c patchfile:** Apply patch to the entire directory\n    *   **patch originalfile patchfile:** Apply patch to specific file\n\n#### file utility\n\n*   The extension of a files does not determine the real nature of a file (a .txt can actually be an executable). So the **file** utility is used for this reason\n\n\u003e It is a good practice to use the `-dry-run` option with the `patch` and `rsync` commands to test\n\n### Backing up and Compressing Data\n\n#### Backing-up\n\n*   **rsync \u003csource\u003e \u003cdestination\u003e:** Used to synchronize entire directory trees,usually used with `-r` option (Basically a copy/backup command). the source and destination can be on a local machine or in a network machine\n\n#### Compressing\n\nIn Linux there are several method for compressing data:\n\n*   **gzip:** Most used and very fast, produces `.gz` compressed files:\n    *   **gzip \\* \u003cuncompressed-file\u003e:** compress all files in the given dir (current dir by default), each file is compressed an renamed with `.gz` extension. use `-r` option to include the files inside directories in the compresion.\n    *   **gzip -d \u003ccompressed-file\u003e** or **gunzip \u003ccompressed-file\u003e:** decompress\n*   **bzip2:** More space efficient than gzip but slower, same syntax and produces `.bz2` compressed files.\n*   **xz:** Most space efficient but also very slow, usually removes the input dir/file if operation succeeds and produces `.xz` compressed files:\n    *   **xz \u003cuncompressed-file\u003e:** compress the given dir/file (default compression level = -6).\n    *   use `-k` option to avoid removing dir/file if the operation succeds\n    *   use `-d` option for decompression\n*   **zip:** Used for compatibility with other OS used by Linux.\n    *   **zip \u003czip-name\u003e.zip \u003cdir\u003e:** compress the given dir/file an places its content in the .zip with the given name. if the .zip aleady exists by default it appends new content an replaces content with the same name.\n    *   **unzip \u003czip-name\u003e.zip -d \u003cextract-dir\u003e:** extracts contents df .zip file and places them in the given directory\n*   **tar (\"tape archive\"):** used to group files in an archive called **tarball**. It can optionally compress while creating the archive or decompress while extracting:\n    *   **tar -xvf \u003cinput\u003e.tar/.gz:** Extracts files in the given tar and places into a dir with the same name. It can be a `.tar` or a `.tar.gz/tgz`\n    *   **tar -cvf \u003coutput\u003e.tar \u003cinput-dir\u003e:** Creates and archive\n    *   **tar -zcvf \u003coutput\u003e.tar.gz/tgz \u003cinput-dir\u003e:** Creates and archive and compress it with `gzip`\n    *   **tar -jcvf \u003coutput\u003e.tar.bz2/tbz \u003cinput-dir\u003e:** Creates and archive and compress it with `bz2`\n    *   **tar -Jcvf \u003coutput\u003e.tar.xz/txz \u003cinput-dir\u003e:** Creates and archive and compress it with `xz`\n\n#### Disk-to-Disk Copying (dd)\n\n*   The **dd** program is very useful for copying raw data (disk space).\n*   Use carefully because raw copy basically erases and replaces the data\n    *   **dd if= of= bs= count=\u003cnum-blocks\u003e**\n\nChapter 11: Text Editors\n========================\n\n### Creating Files Without Using an Editor\n\n#### echo\n\nUse `echo` to redirect the output to file, creating it at the same time, then appending lines to it.\n\n    echo line one \u003e myfile\n    echo line two \u003e\u003e myfile\n    echo line three \u003e\u003e myfile\n\n#### cat\n\nuse `cat` and redirection\n\n    cat \u003c\u003c EOF \u003e myfile\n    \u003e line one\n    \u003e line two\n    \u003e line three\n    \u003e EOF\n\n### Basic Text Editors: nano and gedit\n\n#### nano\n\n*   Text-terminal based editor that displays all the help you need at the bottom\n*   use the `nano` command to create a file and starts editing\n    *   `nano \u003cfilename\u003e`\n\n#### gedit\n\n*   Graphical editor that needs a Graphical Desktop environment to run\n*   use the `gedit` command to create a file and starts the **gedit** graphical interface\n    *   `gedit \u003cfilename\u003e`\n\n### Advanced Text Editors\n\n**vi** and **emacs** are more advanced text editors and have a basic purely text-based form that can run in a non-graphical environment.\n\n### vi\n\n*   Usually the actual program installed on the system is **vim** (vi Improved)\n*   **gvim** is a extended graphical interface version of **vi**\n*   All commands are entered through the keyboard\n\n#### vi modes\n\n1.  **Command:**\n    *   It's the starting/default mode\n    *   Each key is and editor command that can modify file contents\n2.  **Insert:**\n    *   Type `i` to enter to _Insert_ mode and `Esc` to exit.

file to the new of another file\n*   `cat \u003e file`: It will create a file and any subsequent lines typed will go into the file until CTRL-D is pressed\n*   `cat \u003e\u003e file`: Any subsequent lines are appended to the an existing file until CTRL-D is pressed.\n*   `tac`: (cat spelled backwards) works as `cat` but prints the lines of a file in reverse order.\n\n### echo\n\nUsually used to display texts but can also be used to create new files and append contents:\n\n*   `echo string \u003e newfile`: The specified string is placed in a new file.\n*   `echo string \u003e\u003e existingfile`: The specified string is appended to the end of an already existing file.\n*   `-e` optoin enables the use of special characters like `\\n`,`\\t`,etc\n\n### sed\n\n*   **sed (stream editor)** used to modify (search and replace) the contents of a file usually placing the contents into a new file.\n*   Allows you to apply a **sed** command to a file to modify it and then move the final content to a desired output\n    *   `sed -e \u003ccommand1\u003e \u003cfilename\u003e`: Execute sed commands on the file and outputs the result on the terminal.\n    *   `sed -f scriptfile \u003cfilename\u003e`: Apply a script file with sed commands and outputs the result on the terminal.\n    *   use the `-i` option to store the result in the same file\n*   `sed` uses both `/` and `:` as delimitiers\n    *   `sed s:pattern:replace_string:g file1 \u003e file2`\n*   Usually the result is stored in a new file and if everything is ok the first file is replaced\n    *   `sed s/pattern/replace_string/g file1 \u003e file2`\n    *   `mv file2 file1`\n\nUsed to create and repeatedly edit and/or extract contents\n\n### awk\n\n*   It is used to extract and print specific contents of a file\n*   The input file is read one line at a time, and, for each line, awk matches the given pattern in the given order and performs the requested action\n    *   `awk '\u003ccommand\u003e' var=value file`: Apply the awk command to the file\n        *   `awk -F: '{ print $1 }' /etc/passwd`: Print first and seventh field of every line `-F:` option is used to specify a particular field separator\n    *   `awk -f scriptfile var=value file`: Apply a awk script file\n\n### File Manipulation Utilities\n\n*   `sort`: sorts the **lines** of a file. `sort \u003cfilename\u003e`\n*   `uniq`: used to remove duplicate, consecutive lines in a file\n    *   `sort \u003cfile\u003e | uniq` sort file and remove duplicates produces the same result as `sort -u file`\n*   `paste`: can be used paste horizontally or vertically, to combine or append contents of files\n    *   adds delimiters between paste `-d`\n    *   append contents (horizontal) `-s`\n*   `join`: is an enhanced version of paste to combine contents of files without repeating common fields or data.\n*   `split`: is used to break up/split a file into equal sized segments, creates a new set of files.\n\n### grep\n\n*   Used to search strings within files\n*   `grep \u003cpattern\u003e \u003cfile\u003e`\n    *   The pattern can be a combination of string and regexp\n    *   `-e` for explicit use pf regular expression\n    *   `-v` option print all lines that do **NOT** match the pattern\n    *   `-C N` specify the number `N` of context lines.\n\n### Extra test utilities\n\n*   `tr`: translates or replaces a set of characters to another set\n    *   `tr [options] 'set1' 'set2'` check [tr link](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS101x.2+1T2015/courseware/d5b9551efa684412abe71a1976a0f164/a2314bbb95e54581a49f835fb64f618b/)\n        *   `cat input_file | tr '\\t' [:space:]` : replace tabs for spaces\n*   `tee`: takes the output of any command and saves it to a file besides display it on the standard output\n    *   `ls -l | tee newfile`\n*   `wc`: counts the number of lines, words and chars in a file, use `-l` for lines and `-w` for words\n*   `cut`: used for manipulating column-based files and extract specific columns.\n*   `tail`: prints the last few lines of each named file\n    *   `tail -f \u003cfile\u003e`: To continually monitor new output in a growing file\n\n### Large files utilities\n\n*   The `less` command is equivalent to the cat command but useful for large files because it does need to place everything into memory and allows scrolling\n*   `strings` command is used to extract the printable characters string found in a file\n    *   `strings book1.xls | grep my_string`\n*   the **z-type** command families is used to work with compressed files **zcat**, **zless**, **zdiff**, and **zgrep**.\n\n### Regular Expressions\n\n*   Regular expressions are different from the wildcards\n*   Regular expressions are text strings used for matching a specific pattern they use **meta-characters**\n*   Search patterns:\n    *   `.(dot)` : Match any single character\n    *   `a|z` : Match a or z\n    *   `$` : Match end of string\n    *   `*` : Match preceding item 0 or more times\n    *   `.*` : Match string\n\nChapter 14: Network Operations\n==============================\n\nIntro Concepts\n--------------\n\n*   A network is a group of computers/devices connected together through communication channels such as cables or wireless\n*   Internet \"the network of networks\"\n\n### IP Addresses\n\n*   The Internet Protocol (**IP**) address is a logical network unique address. The address is essential for routing packets.\n\n#### IPv4\n\n*   Uses 32-bit addresses (4.3 billion)\n*   Addresses are divided in 4 octets and five classes ![](./img/ipv4_add.jpg)\n    *   Network addresses (Net ID): used to identify the network\n    *   Host address (Host ID): used to identify the Host in the network\n    *   Multicast addr: Used to broadcast to multiple devices simultaneously\n\n##### Class A Network Addresses\n\n*   First bit of Net ID = 0b\n*   First octet of an IP address as their Net ID and use the other three octets as the Host ID\n*   Maximum of 126 Class A networks available\n*   The 0000000 and 1111111 are reserved\n*   2^24 = 16.7 million unique hosts on its network.\n*   Range: 1.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255. ![](./img/ipv4_class_a.jpg)\n\n##### Class B Network Addresses\n\n*   First two bits of Net ID = 10b\n*   First two octets of the IP address as their Net ID and the last two octets as the Host ID\n*   Maximum of 2^14=16384 Class B networks available\n*   2^16 = of 65,536 unique hosts on its network.\n*   Range: 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255. ![](./img/ipv4_class_b.jpg)\n\n##### Class C Network Addresses\n\n*   First three bits of Net ID = 110b\n*   First three octets of the IP address as their Net ID and the last octet as their Host ID\n*   Maximum of 2^21= ~2.1 million Class C networks available\n*   2^8 = 256 of unique hosts on its network.\n*   Range: 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255.. ![](./img/ipv4_class_c.jpg)\n\n###### Allocating IP address\n\n*   A range of IP Addresses is requested from your ISP and the choice of which class of IP address depends on the size of the network.\n*   To assign IP Address:\n    *   Manully = static = never changing\n        *   `ipcalc \u003coct3.oct2.oct1.oct0/num-bits-network\u003e`\n        *   For a class C: `ipcalc 192.168.0.0/24`\n    *   Dynamically = could change over time or every time the system reboots. **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)** protocol is used for dynamically assigning of IP address\n\n#### Name Resolution\n\n*   The Domain Name System (DNS) is used to convert numerical IP address into human-readable format (hostname)\n    *   `hostname` with no args is used to view the system‚Äôs hostname. -\n\n\u003e The special hostname **localhost** is associated with the IP address **127.0.0.1**, and describes the **machine you are currently on**\n\n#### Network interfaces\n\n*   They are connections channels between a device and a network\n*   **Network Config files:** used to ensure that interfaces functions correctly\n    *   Basic network configuration file: `/etc/network/interfaces`\n    *   To starts network config: `etc/init.d/networking start`\n    *   View IP address: `/sbin/ip addr show`\n    *   View routing info `/sbin/ip route show`\n    *   Send a ping to a machine attached to the network `ping \u003chostname\u003e`.\n\n#### Routing\n\n*   A network requires the connection of many nodes.\n*   Servers maintain routing tables containing the addresses of each node in the network IP Routing protocols enable routers to build up a forwarding table that correlates final destinations with the next hop addresses.\n\n##### route\n\n*   The `route` command is used to view and change the IP routing table\n    *   `route ‚Äìn`: Show current routing table\n    *   `route add -net address`: Add static route\n    *   `route del -net addres`: Delete static route\n\n##### traceroute\n\n*   The `traceroute` command is used to nspect the route which the data packet takes to reach the destination host\n    *   `traceroute \u003cdomain\u003e`: print the route taken by the packet to reach the network host\n\n#### Networking tools\n\n*   `ethtool eth0`: Queries network interfaces\n*   `netstat -r`: Displays all active connections and routing tables.\n*   `nmap -sp \u003coct3.oct2.oct1.oct0/num-bits-network\u003e`: Scans open ports on a network.\n*   `tcpdump`: Dumps network traffic for analysis.\n*   `iptraf`: Monitors network traffic in text mode.\n\n#### IPv6\n\n*   Uses 128-bit addresses (3.4x10^38)\n\n\u003e IPv4 and iPv6 do **NOT** inter-operate, there are separated protocols and migrating from one to another requires significant effort\n\n##### Host\n\n*   A host is a computer with a Web server that handles all the services requested through the pages of a website.\n*   A host can also be the company that provides this service of having a computer as a web server\n\n### Graphical, Non-Graphical Browsers and Browsing Tools\n\n### Non-Graphical Browsers\n\n*   Used to retrieve, transmit and explore information resources usually on the WWW\n    *   **lynx:** Configurable text-based web browser\n    *   **links** or **elinks:** Based on lynx.

Usually requires user name and password. Command line FTP clients:\n    *   ftp, ncftp, yafc\n    *   sftp: It is secure mode conection which uses Secure Shell protocol (**ssh**)\n\n#### SSH\n\n*   Secure Shell is a cryptographic network protocol used for secure data communication\n*   Used for administering remote system\n*   Run a command on the remote system: `ssh \u003cremotesystem\u003e \u003ccommand\u003e`\n*   It needs the remote password\n*   **Secure Copy (scp):** Program that uses **ssh** to securely move/copy files between networked hosts\n*   scp \u003cuser@remotesystem\u003e:/home/user/\n\nChapter 15 \u0026 16: Bash Shell Scripting\n=====================================\n\n### Intro\n\n*   a **shell** is a command line **interpreter** which provides the user interface for terminal windows\n*   The first line of a script file starts with `#!`, contains the full path of the command interpreter (Usually `/bin/bash`)\n*   All shell scripts generate a return value upon finishing execution; the value can be set with the `exit` statement\n*   By default return value is stored in the environment variable represented by `$?`\n*   To execute a shell script its executable permission must be set or the bash command can be used: `bash script.sh`\n*   The available shells for the syste, are listed in `/etc/shells`\n\n### Syntax\n\n#### Special Characters\n\n*   **#**: Used to add a comment, except when used as **\\\\#**, or as **#!** when starting a script\n*   **\\\\**: Indicates continuation on to the next line\n*   **$**:Indicates what follows is a variable\n\n##### Chaining of commands\n\n*   **;**: Used to separate commands and execute them sequentially, as if they had been typed on separate lines whether or not the preceding ones succeed.\n*   **\u0026\u0026**: operator will continue executing until something fails. Processing stops as soon as a condition evaluates to false\n    *   `make \u0026\u0026 make install \u0026\u0026 make clean`\n*   **||**: operator will only continue executing until something succeeds. Only one command is executed successfully. Processing stops as soon as anything is true\n    *   `cat file1 || cat file2 || cat file3`\n\n#### Parameters\n\n*   Within a script the parameters are represented with `$`:\n    *   **$0**: Script name\n    *   **$1, $2, $3, etc.** : First, Second, Third parameter, etc.\n    *   **$\\***: All parameters\n    *   **$#** : Number of arguments\n        \n            #!/bin/bash\n            echo \"This is a sample script named: $0\"\n            echo \"Number of paramaters passed: $#\"\n            echo \"Script Parameter 1 is: $1\"\n            echo \"Script Parameter 2 is: $2\"\n        \n\n### Built-in Shell Commands\n\nShell scripts execute sequences of commands and other types of statements.\n\n*   **Compiled applications:** Binary executable files that you can find on the filesystem (like under `/usr/bin`)\n*   **Built-in bash commands:** Which can only be used to display the output within a terminal shell\n*   Scripts from other interpreted languages ![](.\\img\\builtin_cmds.jpg)\n\n#### Command Substitution and Nesting\n\n*   The result of one command can be part of another one. To do this for the inner command we can use backticks **\\`** or more modern (and prefered) `$( )`\n*   The result of the innermost command will be executed in a new shell and the standard output of the shell will be inserted where the command substitution was done.\n*   Example:\n    *   `cd /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/`\n\n### Variables\n\n*   The variables created within a script are available only to the subsequent steps of that script. We must use **export** to make them available\n    *   `export VAR=value`\n    *   `VAR=value ; export VAR`\n*   While child processes are allowed to modify the value of exported variables, the parent will not see any changes; **exported variables are not shared**, they are only copied and inherited\n\n### Script Functions\n\n*   Also called subroutines is a code block that implements a set of operations\n*   It requires previous declaration:\n    \n        #!/bin/bash\n        display () {\n          echo \"This is a sample function, script name: $0\"\n          echo \"Number of func paramaters passed: $#\"\n          echo \"Function Parameter 1 $1\"\n          echo \"Function Parameter 2 $2\"\n          return 0\n        }\n        display \"Pepe\" \"Sandoval\"\n        display \"Pepe\"\n    \n\nConditionals\n------------\n\n### The `if-then-elif-else-fi` structure\n\n*   `[ conditional ]` and more modern `[[ conditional ]]` are used to delineate the test condition, spacing is necessary.\n*   The General structure of the `if-else` is the following, `elif` can also be used\n    \n        if [ condition ] ; then\n         statements\n        elif [ condition ] ; then\n         statements\n        else\n         statements\n        fi\n    \n    or the equivalent\n    \n        if [ condition ]\n        then\n         statements\n        elif [ condition ]\n        then\n         statements\n        else\n         statements\n        fi\n    \n\n### Conditionals Evaluation Expressions\n\n*   **File Testing:** bash provides a set of file conditionals (check the full list with `man 1 test`)\n    *   `-e file`: Check if the file exists.\n    *   `-d file`: Check if the file is a directory.\n    *   `-f file`: Check if the file is a regular file (i.e., not a symbolic link, device node, directory, etc.)\n    *   `-s file`: Check if the file is of non-zero size.\n    *   `-g file`: Check if the file has sgid set.\n    *   `-u file`: Check if the file has suid set.\n    *   `-r file`: Check if the file is readable.\n    *   `-w file`: Check if the file is writable.\n    *   `-x file`: Check if the file is executable.\n\nExamples:\n\n    #!/bin/bash\n    file=\"./test.txt\"\n    if [ -f $file ] ; then\n        echo \"$file file exists\"\n    fi\n\n    # test for NULL or uninitialized on first parameter passed\n    if [[ -z $1 ]]; \n    then \n        echo \"No parameter passed.\"\n    else\n        echo \"Parameter passed = $1\"\n    fi\n\n    # test for NULL or uninitialized on first parameter passed\n    if [[ $# -lt 1 ]]; \n    then \n        echo \"# parameters passed ($#) is \u003c 1\"\n    else\n        echo \"# parameters passed ($#) is \u003e 1\"\n    fi\n\n*   **Numerical Testing:** bash provides a set of numerical conditionals that use the syntax: `exp1 -op exp2` the operators are:\n    *   `-eq`: Equal to\n    *   `-ne`: Not equal to\n    *   `-gt`: Greater than\n    *   `-lt`: Less than\n    *   `-ge`: Greater than or equal to\n    *   `-le`: Less than or equal to\n\nExample:\n\n    #!/bin/bash\n    var=1\n    if [ $var -eq 1 ] ; then\n        echo \"var is equal to 1\"\n    fi\n\n*   **Arithmetic Expressions:**\n    *   To evaluate an arithmetic expresion the built-in shell format must be used: `$((expr))`\n    *   The command `let` can also be used\n\nExample:\n\n    #!/bin/bash\n    op1=$((1 + 3)); echo \"operator 1 is: $op1\"\n    let op2=( 2 + 1 ); echo \"operator 2 is: $op2\"\n    echo \"Arithmetic example $(($op1+$op2))\"\n\n### Boolean expressions\n\n*   `||` OR, `\u0026\u0026` AND, `!` NOT can be used in conditionals\n\nExample\n\n    #!/bin/bash\n    AGE=26\n    if [[ $AGE -ge 20 ]] \u0026\u0026 [[ $AGE -lt 30 ]] ; then\n        echo \"you are in your 20s\"\n    fi\n\n### String Manipulation \u0026 Evaluation\n\n*   **\\==** and **!=** : Can be used to compare strings.\n    *   `if [[ $color == \"red\" ]]` or `if [[ \"$color\" == red ]]`\n    *   `if [[ $color != \"red\" ]]` or `if [[ \"$color\" != red ]]`\n*   bash allows string manipulation through the following operations\n    *   **\\[\\[ !

No month matches: $month\" ;;\n    esac\n\nLooping\n-------\n\n### for\n\nThe general syntax for the `for` statement is the following, the `for` variables does not need to be declared previously:\n\n    for variable-name in list\n    do\n        commands\n        ...\n    done\n\nExample:\n\n    #!/bin/bash\n    i=1\n    for filename in $(ls)\n    do\n        echo \"filename $i is: $filename\"\n        i=$(($i+1))\n    done\n\n### while\n\nThe general structure of the `while` statement is the following:\n\n    while [ condition-is-true ]\n    do\n        commands\n        ...\n    done\n\nExample:\n\n    #!/bin/bash\n    i=0\n    while [ $i -lt 10 ]\n    do\n        echo \"i values is: $i\"\n        i=$(($i+1))\n    done\n\n### until\n\nThe general structure of the `until` statement is the following:\n\n    until [ condition-is-false ]\n    do\n        commands\n        ...\n    done\n\nExample:\n\n    #!/bin/bash\n    i=10\n    until [ $i -lt 0 ]\n    do\n        echo \"i values is: $i\"\n        i=$(($i-1))\n    done\n\nDebugging\n---------\n\n*   In bash we can run scripts in debug mode by doing `bash -x ./script-file`\n*   inthe script we can turn on/off the debugging mode with the following commands\n    *   `set -x`: Turns **ON** debugging\n    *   `set +x`: Turns **OFF** debugging\n\n### Input and Output Redirection\n\n*   To redirect the output of a program we use the `\u003e` and `\u003e\u003e` operator so instead of directing its output to its default output stream we directed to a file or to another program, same case applies for input redirection.\n*   When redirecting to a file the `\u003e` create/overwrite a file and the `\u003e\u003e` operator appends to the file\n    \n*   In Linux all programs that run are given three open file streams\n    \n    *   **stdin (0)**: By default keyboard for programs that run from terminal\n    *   **stdout (1)**: By default screen for programs that run from terminal\n    *   **stderr (2):** Where output error messages are saved\n\n### Extra shell utilities\n\n*   **mktemp:** Used to create temporary files and directories with random names\n    *   `TEMP=$(mktemp /tmp/tempfile.XXXXXXXX)`: Create a temporary file. Use the `-d` option for a temp dir\n*   **/dev/null**: A black hole use to discard the output of a command but **errors** will still appear\n*   **$RANDOM**: Used for generating random numbers\n    *   **$(($RANDOM%\u003crange\u003e))**\n\nChapter 17: Printing\n====================\n\nPrinting itself requires software that converts information from the application you are using to a language your printer can understand. The Linux standard for printing software is the **Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS)**.\n\n*   Printers manufactured by different companies may use their own particular print languages and formats.\n\n### CUPS: Common UNIX Printing System\n\n*   It is the Linux standard software for printing\n*   CUPS is the software that is used behind the scenes to print from applications\n*   It converts page descriptions produced by your application and sends the information to the printer\n*   Requires:\n    *   **Configuration Files:** used by the CUPS scheduler and stored at `/etc/cups/`:\n        *   `printers.conf`: contains printer specific settings for each printer there is a description for the printer‚Äôs status and capabilities; generated only after adding a printer\n        *   `cupsd.conf`: system settings not printer specific like which systems can access CUPS network capabilities, how printers are advertised on the local network, etc.\n    *   **Scheduler:** manages print jobs and manages print jobs and the flow of data through all CUPS components.\n    *   **Job Files:** Stores print requests as files under the `/var/spool/cups`\n    *   **Log Files:** Placed in `/var/log/cups` and are used by the scheduler to record activities that have taken place like access, error, and page records.\n    *   **Filter:** Used to convert job file formats to printable formats.\n    *   **Printer Drivers:** Contain descriptions for currently connected and configured printers, usually stored under `/etc/cups/ppd/`\n    *   **Backend:** It is the via used to send data to the printer and also helps to locate devices connected to the system.\n*   When you execute a print command, the scheduler validates the command and processes the print job creating job files according to the settings specified in configuration files. Simultaneously, the scheduler records activities in the log files. Job files are processed with the help of the filter, printer driver, and backend, and then sent to the printer.\n*   CUPS web interface is available at: `http://localhost:631`\n    \n          sudo /etc/init.d/cups {start | restart | status stop}\n          sudo update-rc.d cups restart {enable | disable}\n    \n    ![](./img/cups.jpg)\n    \n*   The commands `lp`, `lpr` and `lpstat -a` are used for printing and print status\n    \n\n#### PDF editing\n\nthe **pdftk** is a great tool for manipulating PDF files it can merge, split, rotate, encrypt, repair, pull pages, export data, etc. [pdftk](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS101x.2+1T2015/courseware/6117e9680b8444cf99cfbde8767c47cd/d0afd8b6a7bb4e15b7449c97f532d69f/1)\n\nChapter 18: Local Security Principles\n=====================================\n\n### User Accounts\n\n*   Linux identifies each user with an user ID (**UID**) and uses a database that associates each **username** with each **UID**\n*   Creating a user implies adding new user information is added to the user database, creating a home dir and populated with some essential files\n*   The `/etc/passwd` file stores the following essential fields for each user:\n    1.  **Username:** User login name (between 1 and 32 characters)\n    2.  **Password:**\n        *   User paswword in _encrypted_ format\n        *   The character **x** if the password is stored in the `/etc/shadow` file\n    3.  **User ID (UID):**\n        *   UID 0: Reserved foor root user\n        *   UID \\[1,99\\]: Other predefenied accounts\n        *   UID \\[100,999\\]: System accounts and groups\n        *   UID \\[1000,+inf\\]: Normal users\n    4.  **Group ID (GID):** Primary groupd ID; the ID stored in the `/etc/group` file\n    5.  **User Info:** Optional field for extra information such as the complete name of the user\n    6.  **Home Dir Path:** The absolute path location of user's home directory\n    7.  **Shell Path:** The absolute location of a user's default shell\n\n### Type of Accounts\n\n*   The `last` utility, which shows the last time each user logged into the system\n*   Linux distinguishes between four types of accounts to isolate processes and workloads:\n    1.  root\n    2.  System\n    3.  Normal\n    4.  Network\n\n### root\n\n*   Most privileged account with authority over the entire system (aka **superuser**), so it has **NO security restrictions** upon it\n*   When signed as root the shell displays a **#**\n    \n    ![](./img/root_priv.jpg \"Partitions example\")\n    \n*   Has the ability to carry out all System Administration. Privileges (root) are required to perform tasks such as:\n    *   Add/remove accounts\n    *   Change user paswwords\n    *   Remove/Modify system files\n    *   Managing Software packages and Installing SW\n    *   Restarting system services\n    *   etc.\n\n#### su\n\n*   Elevates the privileges of a user indefinitely (until the user wants to).\n*   The **root account password** is needed.\n\n#### sudo\n\n*   Elevates the user privileges for **ONE** command. Calls to **sudo** trigger a lookup in the /etc/sudoers file, or in the /etc/sudoers.d directory, which first validates that the calling user is allowed to use sudo and that it is being used within permitted scope\n*   The **user account password** is needed NOT the root password\n*   Has extensive logging features, that means it keeps track of when the command is used and if it was or not successful. This info is stored in the `/var/log/secure` and `/var/log/auth.log` files. The typical logging messages contains:\n    *   Calling date, time and username\n    *   Terminal info\n    *   Working directory\n    *   User account invoked\n    *   Command with arguments\n*   Users' authorization for using sudo is based on configuration info stored in the `/etc/sudoers` file and in the `/etc/sudoers.d` dir:\n    *   basic entry:\n        *   `who where = (as_whom) what`\n            *   the `visudo` command can be used to properly edit the **sudoers** file this file **affects ALL users**\n            *   Adding a file to the `/etc/sudoers.d` with same name of the user that contains the individuial user's sudo configuration wil **ONLY affects this user**.\n\n#### Creating a new user in Linux\n\nTo create and account using useradd, as **root** only:\n\n1.  `useradd \u003cusername\u003e`\n2.  `passwd \u003cusername\u003e`\n3.  Enter password when prompted and retype to confirm\n\n**SUID** (Set owner User ID upon execution) is a special kind of file permission given to a file that provides temporary permissions to a user to run a program with the permissions of the file owner (which may be root) instead of the permissions held by the user.\n\n### Process isolation\n\n*   Processes are naturally isolated, one program cannot access the resources of another process even if both are running with the same user privileges\n*   It is the reason Linux is considered more secure than other OS\n\nAdditional security mechanism:\n\n*   **Control Groups (cgroups):** Allows to group processes and associate finite resources to each cgroup.\n*   **Virtualization:** HW is emulated so entire systems can be run isolated, basically run isolated Virtual machines on physical host\n*   **Linux Containers (LXC):** Makes it possible to run multiple isolated Linux systems (containers) on a single system using **cgroups**\n\n### Harware devices\n\n*   Linux limits user access to HW devices in a manner that is extremely similar to a regular file\n*   HW interaction:\n    1.  Applications interacts by engaging the filesystem layer (independent of the actual HW device),\n    2.  The filesystem layer opens a device special file (**device node**) under **/dev** dir that corresponds to the device being accessed\n    3.  Each device node has standard owner, group and permissions. Security applies as if it where a file\n\n##### Hard Disk Example\n\n\u003e A Hard disk for example are represented as /dev/sd\\* which is the device node of the Hard Disk so theoretically if a user has the appropriate permissions it could do something like `echo hello world \u003e /dev/sda1` which shows that this HW device can be interacted as if it were a file but this could actually destroy the FS. So the normal **reading and writing is done at a higher level through the filesystem, and never through direct access to the device node**.\n\n### Paswords\n\n*   Passwords are stored in an encrypted format in a secondary file named `/etc/shadow` and only those with root access can modify/read this file.\n*   **Password Encryption:** Most Linux distributions rely on a modern password encryption algorithm called **SHA-512 (Secure Hashing Algorithm 512 bits)**\n*   **Password Aging:** Method that ensures a password update every certain time. Uses the **chage** which configures the expiration date/time of user info\n*   **Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM):** Tool that automatically verifies that a password created/modified using **passwd** is sufficiently strong.\n\n#### Boot Process Passwords Security (Requiring Boot Loader Passwords)\n\nTo secure the boot process in GRUB version 1:\n\n1.  Invoke the `grub-md5-crypt` enter and confirm password when prompted.\n2.  Edit the `/boot/grub/grub.conf` file, add `password --md5`\n\nTo secure the boot process in GRUB version 2:\n\n1.  Edit the system configuration files in `/etc/grub.d`.\n2.  Run the `update-grub` command. Check [GRUB2-Pass](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Passwords) for example\n\n#### HW Vulnerability\n\nWhen HW is physically accessible, some security breaching types are:\n\n*   **Key-logging:** Record real time activity of a HW device (key press)\n*   **Network sniffing:** Capturing network packet level data\n*   **Booting with rescue disk or USB key**\n*   **Remounting and modifying disk content**\n\n##### Want to show support?\n\nIf you find the information in this page useful and want to show your support, you can make a donation\n\nUse PayPal\n\n   ![](https://www.paypalobjects.com/es_XC/i/scr/pixel.gif)\n\nor\n\n[Donate with Crypto](https://commerce.coinbase.com/checkout/1e4de557-4be8-4674-a2be-417b4a203e72)\n\nThis will help me to create more stuff and fix the existent content... or probably your money will be used to buy beer\n\n[](#page-top)\n\n*   [About](/about)\n*   ¬∑\n*   [Terms of Use](/terms)\n*   ¬∑\n*   [Privacy Policy](/privacy)\n\nCopyright ¬© pepe-docs 2018.

That way, when you create a new note, you can just press the hotkey for a new template and be ready to go!\n\n\u003e üëÄ Step 4: [Preview Quartz Changes](notes/preview%20changes.md)","lastmodified":"2022-07-29T18:05:17.850908319Z","tags":null},"/.trash/philosophy":{"title":"Quartz Philosophy","content":"\n\u003e ‚Äú[One] who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but [they] also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important.‚Äù ‚Äî Richard Hamming\n\n## Why Quartz?\nHosting a public digital garden isn't easy. There are an overwhelming number of tutorials, resources, and guides for tools like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), yet none of them have super easy to use *free* tools to publish that garden to the world.\n\nI've personally found that\n1. It's nice to access notes from anywhere\n2. Having a public digital garden invites open conversations\n3. It makes keeping personal notes and knowledge *playful and fun*\n\nI was really inspired by [Bianca](https://garden.bianca.digital/) and [Joel](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)'s digital gardens and wanted to try making my own.\n\n**The goal of Quartz is to make hosting your own public digital garden free and simple.** You don't even need your own website. Quartz does all of that for you and gives your own little corner of the internet.\n","lastmodified":"2022-07-29T18:05:17.850908319Z","tags":null},"/.trash/preview-changes":{"title":"Preview Changes","content":"\nIf you'd like to preview what your Quartz site looks like before deploying it to the internet, here's exactly how to do that!\n\nNote that both of these steps need to be completed.\n\n## Install `hugo-obsidian`\nThis step will generate the list of backlinks for Hugo to parse. Ensure you have [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (\u003e= 1.16) installed.\n\n```shell\n# Install and link `hugo-obsidian` locally\ngo install github.com/jackyzha0/hugo-obsidian@latest\n```\n\nIf you are running into an error saying that `command not found: hugo-obsidian`, make sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize hugo-obsidian as an executable.\n\nAfterwards, start the Hugo server as shown above and your local backlinks and interactive graph should be populated!\n\n##  Installing Hugo\nHugo is the static site generator that powers Quartz. [Install Hugo with \"extended\" Sass/SCSS version](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) first. Then,\n\n```\n# Navigate to your local Quartz folder\ncd \u003clocation-of-your-local-quartz\u003e\n\n# Start local server\nmake serve\n\n# View your site in a browser at http://localhost:1313/\n```\n\n\u003e üåç Step 5: [Hosting Quartz online!](notes/hosting.md)","lastmodified":"2022-07-29T18:05:17.850908319Z","tags":null},"/.trash/setup":{"title":"Setup","content":"\n## Making your own Quartz\nSetting up Quartz requires a basic understanding of `git`. If you are unfamiliar, [this resource](https://resources.nwplus.io/2-beginner/how-to-git-github.html) is a great place to start!\n\n### Forking\n\u003e A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.\n\nNavigate to the GitHub repository for the Quartz project:\n\nüìÅ [Quartz Repository](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)\n\nThen, Fork the repository into your own GitHub account. If you don't have an account, you can make on for free [here](https://github.com/join). More details about forking a repo can be found on [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).\n\n### Cloning\nAfter you've made a fork of the repository, you need to download the files locally onto your machine. Ensure you have `git`, then type the following command replacing `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/quartz\n```\n\n## Editing\nGreat!

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(ÊµãËØï).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\nüêõ [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)","lastmodified":"2022-07-29T18:05:17.850908319Z","tags":null},"/.trash/updating":{"title":"Updating","content":"\nHaven't updated Quartz in a while and want all the cool new optimizations?
