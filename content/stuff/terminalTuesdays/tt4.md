Terminal Tuesdays #4

This week of terminal Tuesday brings you a useful commandline package.

Are you one of those who get rusty on linux commands then skim through --help or man pages or you just need to find the most common use case of that command/program asap. If yes, then let me introduce "tldr" package.

tldr
It is a package used to get quick and useful summary of linux commands and other programs in colored text.

Usage:
$tldr command_name

Example:
$tldr ls

This wraps up this episode of terminal tuesdays.
