This week of Terminal Tuesdays brings you a useful command-line package.

Are you one of those who get rusty on Linux commands then skim through --help or man pages or you just need to find the most common use case of that command/program asap. If yes, then let me introduce **"tldr"** package.

### Installation:

$_sudo apt install tldr_ 

### Usage:

$_tldr command_name_

### Example:

$_tldr ls_
