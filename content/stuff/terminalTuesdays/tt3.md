Terminal Tuesdays #3

This week of terminal Tuesday brings you the concept of alias.

Sometimes we may need to type long commands for frequently used programs or for doing a task on the terminal, 
this may get cumbersome in the long run.

Here comes the use of alias in Linux.
It can be thought of a shortcut to a long command.

To use it, we must first configure it in .bashrc file found in the home directory.
Done...

To apply the changes in the current terminal we run $source .bashrc

Now we test our alais andddd yesss, we've made our alias.

This wraps up this week of terminal Tuesdays.
