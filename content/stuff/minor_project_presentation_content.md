## What are we creating?
**A Bit-Torrent Client**

---
## What is it based on?
**Bit-Torrent Protocol**

## How traditional downloading works?
![[stuff/client_server.png]]

A computer requests a file from the **central server**, then it copies the file to itself using **File Transfer Protocol**

---
## What is Bit-Torrent Protocol?

![[stuff/p2p.png]]

BitTorrent is a protocol for downloading and distributing files across the Internet.
Participants in the BitTorrent network, calledÂ **peers**, download pieces of files fromÂ _each other, this is what makes it aÂ **peer-to-peer**Â protocol.  

Weâ€™ll investigate how this works, and build our own client that can find peers and exchange data between them.

## Tracker

![[stuff/Pasted image 20220923200609.png|500]]

A tracker is a special type of server that keeps track of seeders and leechers and helps efficient transmission and reassembly of the copied file.

---
## .torrent file
It is a metedata file which describes the contents of the the file going to be downloaded and it contains the information about the trackers.
It is encoded in **bencode** format.

It contains tracker url, a comment, creation date, size of file, name, piece size and a binary blob of SHA-1 hashes of each piece.

## Seeders

A seeder is that computer in the distributed network who is sharing/uploading the file.

---
## Leecher

A leecher is that computer in the distributed network who is downloading the file.

---
## What will it support?
- Download a file from a distributed network of seeders using a `.torrent` file
- A terminal user interface
