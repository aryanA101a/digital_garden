Hi, I am Aryan Arora, from the GDSC App Dev team.
I am here to introduce you about flutter, and I'm sure many of you must have heard about it.

Flutter is an open-source app development framework made by Google. Using it, you can create stunning apps for almost all platforms with just a single codebase.

Now, comes the question.
Why use flutter to create apps?

Cred, Tickertape, BMW, Alibaba, and many more prominent companies are using flutter to create apps in no time.

Speaking of no time, Flutter makes development and debugging super easy and fast.
Hot Reload and Hot Restart let you observe the changes in the app, the moment you change the code.

Talking about speed, this is where flutter shines. Flutter apps have great performance out of the box, which means most of the time you don't have to explicitly optimize your app.

Now, coming on to User Interfaces, one of the great things which come with flutter is the ability to create elegant User Interfaces with buttery smooth animations.
In flutter, everything you do is in Dart language which is an optimized language for creating user interfaces. It is very similar to javascript and easy to grasp.

At the end mai ye kehna chaahunga kii web developers to sab banjaayenge lekin app developer banne ke liye you need guts.
If you have what it takes to become an app developer, come aboard with us.
