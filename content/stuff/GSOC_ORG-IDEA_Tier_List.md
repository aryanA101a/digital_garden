- # JITSI-AV1 codec support
## Overview

AV1 is the next genration video codec developed by the Alliance for Open Media. This project is about adding support for it in the Jitsi Videobridge.

## Description

Currently the Jitsi Videobridge supports VP8, VP9 and H.264 (with some limitations). Given AV1 is designed to be a next generation video codec while being royalty free, we'd like to add support for it.

## Expected outcomes

Working calls with endpopints using the AV1 codec.

- # OpenFoodFacts-simple Flutter interface to Folksonomy Engine
### Project 4: Create a very simple Flutter interface to Folksonomy Engine (our Food Knowledge Graph)

**Description:** 

Making choices regarding food often depends on the food category considered. Some criteria are especially important when choosing a fish or a ready made meal. Showing and explaining those criteria in context (and whether the product meets them) when scanning a product is be very useful.

The Food Knowledge graph is a system to augment product data, based on a taxonomy of knowledge. This is implemented as a separate service in Python.

**Expected outcomes:**

-   Implement CRUD interfaces for key/values manipulation
    
-   Implement CRUD interfaces for property creation
    
-   Implement Private/Public key/value management
    
-   Bundle that into a UI library
    
-   Create a sample Flutter application making use of this library

- # Submitty-Containers for automatic grading
**Containers for Automated Grading**

Automated testing of student submitted software carries system and security risks from malicious code but also simply buggy or inefficient code. Upper level coursework on advanced topics in computer science including networking, operating systems, and kernel development are especially complex challenges.

Submitty supports a variety of tools to securely test including both sandboxing and containerization (Docker). These tools must manage and limit system resources (time, CPU, processes, memory, files, system calls, sockets, etc.)

We provide container images appropriate for the most common programming languages (Python, C/C++, Java) used in introductory programming courses.

[https://hub.docker.com/u/submitty](https://hub.docker.com/u/submitty)

The next step is to facilitate the creation of instructor-customized container images (with specific languages, packages, databases, etc.). Care must be taken to ensure small container size and efficient performance.
