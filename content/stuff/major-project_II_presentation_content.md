**Description**

RUSH is a command-line text editor inspired by the simplicity and functionality of the legendary nano text editor. Developed as a foray into systems programming, RUSH provides an immersive dive into low-level details while implementing essential features. From taking input directly from the keyboard to managing output on the screen, RUSH offers a comprehensive exploration of system calls and terminal manipulation.


**Key Features:**

1. **Input Handling:** Utilizes the read() system call to precisely control input from the keyboard, enabling fine-grained interaction with the editor.
2. **Timeout Management:** Implements timeouts for read() to prevent blocking indefinitely, enhancing performance by returning promptly upon input detection.
3. **Terminal Mode Control:** Transitions from canonical mode to raw mode, configuring terminal attributes to enable direct manipulation of input and output behaviors.
4. **Error Handling:** Employs perror() for efficient error management, providing descriptive error messages to aid in debugging and graceful handling of exceptions.
5. **Control Character Mapping:** Implements control character mapping to interpret Ctrl + alphabetic key combinations, facilitating intuitive keyboard shortcuts.
6. **Output Management:** Utilizes the write() system call for precise output control, allowing for efficient rendering of text and escape sequences on the terminal.
7. **Escape Sequences:** Utilizes ANSI escape sequences for advanced terminal manipulation, enabling tasks such as text formatting, cursor movement, and screen clearing.
8. **Window Size Detection:** Implements methods to retrieve window size using ioctl() and fallback mechanisms, ensuring optimal rendering regardless of terminal environment.
9. **Screen Refresh:** Implements screen refresh functionality to update display after each keypress, providing a seamless editing experience with line-by-line clearing and data appending.

- A terminal is a hardware device or software interface used to interact with a computer system, typically through text-based input and output. These were used with other computing machines like mainframes to interact with them.
- Terminals historically consisted of physical devices, like the VT100, connected to a computer, allowing users to input commands and view outputs.

**2. Terminal Emulator:**

- A terminal emulator is a software application that replicates the functionality of a physical terminal on a modern computer.
- It provides a text-based interface to interact with the underlying operating system, allowing users to execute commands, run programs, and access system resources.

**Description:** VT100 terminals, introduced by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in 1978, revolutionized computer interaction by providing a standardized interface for text-based communication between users and computer systems. These terminals laid the groundwork for modern command-line interfaces, influencing the design of subsequent terminal emulators and shaping the evolution of user interaction with computers.

**Historical Significance:**

1. **Pioneering Standardization:** VT100 terminals set a benchmark for terminal design, establishing a common framework for text-based communication across various computer systems.
2. **Enhanced User Experience:** By offering features such as cursor positioning, text formatting, and screen clearing, VT100 terminals significantly improved user interaction with computers, fostering productivity and ease of use.
3. **Legacy in Computing:** Despite the advent of graphical user interfaces, VT100 terminals remain influential in computing history, serving as the foundation for modern terminal emulation software and continuing to influence command-line interfaces.

**Features:**

1. **Cursor Control:** VT100 terminals introduced precise cursor positioning, allowing users to navigate text documents and input data with ease.
2. **Text Formatting:** Users could employ features like bold, underline, and reverse video to enhance text readability and convey emphasis.
3. **Screen Management:** VT100 terminals provided capabilities for scrolling, clearing the screen, and dividing the display into multiple regions, optimizing screen real estate.
4. **Keyboard Support:** These terminals supported a variety of keyboard layouts and configurations, accommodating diverse user preferences and system requirements.

**ANSI Escape Sequences:**

1. **Introduction:** ANSI escape sequences are standardized sequences of characters used to control terminal behavior, including cursor movement, text formatting, and color changes.
2. **Compatibility:** VT100 terminals adopted ANSI escape sequences, ensuring compatibility with emerging standards and facilitating interoperability with other terminal devices and software.
3. **Enhanced Functionality:** By leveraging ANSI escape sequences, developers could implement advanced features such as graphical user interfaces and interactive command-line applications, enhancing the versatility of VT100 terminals.
