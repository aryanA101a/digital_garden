## Set
 A set is a collection of objects where order and repetition does not matter.

> eg. B={1,3,4,7}

- 1 $\in$ B
$\in$ -> element of
- 2$\notin$ B
$\notin$ -> not an element of


## Subsets
- A $\subseteq$ B means A is a subset of B
> eg. {1,3} $\subseteq$ {1,3,4,7}
> eg. {1,7} $\nsubseteq$ {1,3,4,7}


## Set Builder Notation
> **General Form: {x | P(x)}**
> where x = variable
> 			| = such that
> 			P(x) = Property is true

>**eg.  Numbers whose square roots is an integer**
>{x | $\sqrt{x}$ $\in$ Z}


## Empty Set
> {} or $\phi$

>**Is $\phi$ $\subset$ {1,2,3} ?**
>Yes




## Cartesian Product
> Cartesian product of set A and B is defined as
> **AxB = { (a,b) : a $\in$ A and b $\in$ B}**
> that AxB is set of all possible ordered pairs whose first component comes from A and second component comes from B

>**Eg. A = {a,b} and B = {1,2}**
>AxB = {(a,1), (a,2), (b,1), (b,2)}

### Ordered Pair (a,b)
- An ordered pair is a set whose components occur in a special order.
