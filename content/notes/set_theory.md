## Set
 A set is a collection of objects where order and repetition does not matter.

> eg. B={1,3,4,7}

- 1 $\in$ B
$\in$ -> element of
- 2$\notin$ B
$\notin$ -> not an element of


## Subsets
- A $\subseteq$ B means A is a subset of B
> eg. {1,3} $\subseteq$ {1,3,4,7}
> eg. {1,7} $\nsubseteq$ {1,3,4,7}
